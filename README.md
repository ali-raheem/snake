# Snake

Basic Snake game to run on Arduino outputting to a 32x32 LED matrix (MAX72XX library).

Currently you use two buttons to control it turning it left and right from the snakes perspective. An apple appears each time one is eaten (randomly) and you die if the snake bites itself.

`A0` is read to seed the RNG.

This is a clip of an older version running where apples appeared in groups.
